formula provable ?
formula provable in theory ?

SYNTAX
- provable(A) 
- provable(A, Cdnr) 
- provable(A, T) 
- provable(A, T, Cdnr) 

PARAMETERS
- A: formula
- T: theory
- Cdnr: integer

RESULT:  true ,  false  or  fail 

SYNOPSIS

- provable  tests whether the formula  A  is provable in  ll . Since full 
  linear logic is undecidable the search is limited to the depth  Cdnr , 
  which denotes the maximum number of applications of the combined 
  contraction-dereliction rule (premise  B,?B,Gamma , conclusion  ?B,Gamma 
  ). If  Cdnr  is omitted it defaults to 3.
- If the depth  Cdnr  is exhausted and the provability (result  true ) or 
  the unprovability (result  false ) could not be established,  fail  is 
  returned. In this case you can try to call  provable  with a higher  Cdnr .
- If  A  contains no  ?  the provability is decidable and the algorithm 
  returns always  true  or  false .
- If the second argument is a theory,  provable  tests whether the formula  
  A  is provable in  ll  plus  T .

EXAMPLE

> provable( (~p0 | p0) & (~p1 | ? p1) | ? p0 | bot );
	true
> provable( p0 | ?(~p0 X (p1 | ~p1) ), 0 );
  provable( p0 | ?(~p0 X (p1 | ~p1) ), 1 );
	fail
	true
