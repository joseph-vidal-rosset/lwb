ordering of formulas

SYNTAX
- less(A, B) 

PARAMETERS
- A, B: formulas

RESULT:  true  or  false 

SYNOPSIS

- less  tests whether the formula  A  is less than the formula  B  in  ll .
- At first we look at the main connective of the formulas:  bot   <   0   <  
  top   <   1   <  variables  <  exponentials  <  negations  <  conjunctions 
  <  disjunctions  <  implications  <  equivalencies. If  A  and  B  have 
  the same main connective, we compare the first operands with  less , and 
  if these are equal we compare the second operands with  less .
- To compare variable symbols we use a lexicographic ordering that treats 
  successive digits as one number.

EXAMPLE

> less((p2 o-o p3) & p1, p0 | bot);
	true
> less((p0 | p1) o-o p2, (p0 | p2) o-o p1);
	true
> less(p4, p12);
	true
