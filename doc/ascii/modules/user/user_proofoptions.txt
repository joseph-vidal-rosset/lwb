============

options for proof display

SYNTAX
- proofoptions(S, L) 
- proofoptions(S) 
- proofoptions(L) 

PARAMETERS
- S: string
- L: list of strings

RESULT:  true 

SYNOPSIS

- S  is a string indicating the proof style: 
  "proof_wish"  : separate tool called  LWBproof_wish . 
  "indent"  : ASCII-display using indentation.
  "tabular"  : ASCII-display, not indented, but still with labels.
- L  is a list of strings, indicating restrictions of the proof display, 
  which allow to reduce the output in different ways what is most useful for 
  large proofs. The restricions can freely be combined although not all 
  combinations are sensible. 
  "branchings_only"  : restrict the output to the branching steps; the 
  intermediate linear steps are combined in a single multi-rule (*).
  "relevant_only"  : display only the `relevant' parts of a proof node 
  (usually the principal and the side formulae).
  "no_weak"  : omit weakenings. 
  "no_labels"  : omit the labelling of lines (only for proof styles  
  "indent" ,  "tabular" ). 
  "no_emphasizing"  : omit all typographical features such as bold face 
  etc.
  "all"  : reset to no restrictions.

EXAMPLE

> proofoptions( [ "branchings_only" ] );

> proofoptions( "indent", [ "relevant_only" ] );
