closed world assumption theory

SYNTAX
- cwa(T) 
- cwa(T, Vars) 

PARAMETERS
- T: theory
- Vars: list of variables

RESULT:  theory

SYNOPSIS

- One argument:  cwa  computes the closed world assumption theory restricted 
  on the variables in  T  of the theory  T .
- Two arguments:  cwa  computes the closed world assumption theory 
  restricted on the variables in  Vars  of the theory  T .
- Attention: Also in the first case there is a restriction on a list of 
  variables. If you intend to use the result of  cwa  for provability or 
  consistency tests, then you should use  provable  resp.  consistent .
- Choose an appropriate infolevel for additional information during the 
  execution (e.g.  set("infolevel", 3); ).

EXAMPLE

> cwa([p0 & p1, p0 v p2]);
	[p0 & p1, p0 v p2, ~p2]
> cwa([p0 v p1 v p2], [p1, p2, p3]);
	[p0 v p1 v p2, ~p1, ~p2, ~p3]
