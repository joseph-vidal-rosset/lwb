PARAMETERS
- T: theory
- Vars: list of variables

RESULT:  true  or  false

- One argument:  consistent  tests whether the closed world assumption

- Two arguments:  consistent  tests whether the closed world assumption 
  theory restricted on the variables in  Vars  of the theory  T  is 
  consistent.
- Choose an appropriate infolevel for additional information during the 
  execution (e.g.  set("infolevel", 3); ).
