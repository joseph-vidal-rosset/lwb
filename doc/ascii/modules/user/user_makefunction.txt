makefunction
============

create a functional expression

SYNTAX
- makefunction(F, Args) 

PARAMETERS
- F: symbol
- Args: list or array

RESULT:  functional expression

SYNOPSIS

- makefunction  creates a functional expression where  F  is the functor and 
  Args  are the arguments.
- If the functor is later on assigned to a `real' function (type  FUNCDESCR 
  ) then a function call will be performed whenever the functional 
  expression is evaluated.
- If  Args  is an array then no conversion needs to take place.

EXAMPLE

> makefunction( f, [ a & b, c, 3 ] );
	f(a & b, c, 3)
> makefunction( g, array( a & b, c, 3 ) );
	g(a & b, c, 3)
