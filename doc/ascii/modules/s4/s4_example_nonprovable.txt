Typical non-provable formulas
-----------------------------

The axiom that causes the difference between  s4  and  s5  is naturally not 
provable in  s4 .

> fml("5");
	~box p1 -> box ~box p1
> provable(fml("5"));
	false

We cannot move  box  and  dia  inwards and outwards in all cases.

> provable( dia p0 & dia p1  ->  dia(p0 & p1) );
	false
> provable( box(p0 v p1)  ->  box p0 v box p1 );
	false
