cnfnv
=====

conjunctive normal form with new variables

SYNTAX
- cnfnv(A) 
- cnfnv(A, S) 

PARAMETERS
- A: formula
- S: string

RESULT:  formula

SYNOPSIS

- cnfnv  computes a formula in conjunctive normal form. This formula is 
  satisfiable iff the formula  A  is satisfiable (if none of the created 
  variables occurs already in  A ).
- In general the result contains new variables. These variables consists of 
  the string  S  and a counter. The default value for  S  is  "p" .
- In contrast to  cnf , the length of the conjunctive normal form is bounded 
  by a linear function in the length of  A .
- A formula is in conjunctive normal form if it is either  true  or  false  
  or an arranged conjunction of disjunctions of variables and negated 
  variables.

EXAMPLE

> cnfnv(p0 -> p1 & ~p2);
	p0 & (p0 v p0) & (p0 v ~p1) & (p1 v ~p1) & (~p1 v ~p2) & (p1 v p2 v ~p1) & 
(p1 v ~p0 v ~p0)
> cnfnv(~p1, "q");
	~p1
