type test

SYNTAX
- typek(Y, S) 

PARAMETERS
- Y: expression
- S: one of  "fml" ,  "model" ,  "theory" ,  "var" 

RESULT:  true  or  false 

SYNOPSIS

- S  is  "fml" :  typek  tests whether  Y  is a formula in  pltl .
- S  is  "model" :  typek  tests whether  Y  is a model in  pltl . A model 
  is a list of states, where a state is again a list with two entries; the 
  first is a list of literals, where positive literals are meant to be true 
  and negative ones to be false, and the second is a list of integers, 
  indicating the successor states (in linear time logic there is only one 
  successor).
- S  is  "theory" :  typek  tests whether  Y  is a theory in  pltl . A 
  theory is a list of formulas.
- S  is  "var" :  typek  tests whether  Y  is a variable in  pltl .

EXAMPLE

> typek(p1 & F r -> true v ~ G X(p2 B false), "fml");
	true
> typek( [ [[p,q,r], [2]], [[~p,r], [3]], [[~p,~r], [1]]] , "model");
	true
> typek([p2 v F X p3, p5, G(p1 -> p2) v ~false], "theory");
	true
> typek(p2, "var");
	true
