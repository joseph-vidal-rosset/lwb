search for a model

SYNTAX
- model(A) 

PARAMETERS
- A: formula

RESULT:  model of  A  if one was found,  false  otherwise

SYNOPSIS

- model  searches for a model of  A .
- A model is a list of states, where a state is again a list with two 
  entries; the first is a list of literals, where positive literals are 
  meant to be true and negative ones to be false, and the second is a list 
  of integers, indicating the successor states (in linear time logic there 
  is only one successor). Note that shorter models may exist.
- The implementation of  pltl::model  is based on the calculus described in 
  \html{ Stefan Schwendimann.

- In general, the function  satisfiable  is faster.

EXAMPLE

> model( p0 & G(p1 -> ~p0) & X p1 & X F p0 );
	[[[p0, ~p1], [2]], [[p1, ~p0], [3]], [[p0, ~p1], [4]], [[~p1], [4]]]
> model( G F (p0 & (p1 U ~p0))   &  G F (p0 & (~p1 U ~p0)) );
	[[[p1, p0], [2]], [[~p0], [3]], [[p0, ~p1], [4]], [[~p0], [1]]]
> model( F p0 & G ~p0 );
	false
