ordering of formulas

SYNTAX
- less(A, B) 

PARAMETERS
- A, B: formulas

RESULT:  true  or  false 

SYNOPSIS

- less  tests whether the formula  A  is less than the formula  B  in  tk .
- At first we look at the main connective of the formulas:  false   <   true 
  <  variables  <  H formulas  <  P formulas  <  G formulas  <  F formulas  
  <  negations  <  conjunctions  <  disjunctions  <  implications  <  
  equivalencies. If  A  and  B  have the same main connective, we compare 
  the first operands with  less , and if these are equal we compare the 
  second operands with  less .
- To compare variable symbols we use a lexicographic ordering that treats 
  successive digits as one number.

EXAMPLE

> less((p2 -> P p1) & (p3 v p4), p1 v true);
	true
> less((p2 v p3) <-> G p4, (p1 v p3) <-> G p4);
	false
> less(p7, p61);
	true
