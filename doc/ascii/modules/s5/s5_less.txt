ordering of formulas

SYNTAX
- less(A, B) 

PARAMETERS
- A, B: formulas

RESULT:  true  or  false 

SYNOPSIS

- less  tests whether the formula  A  is less than the formula  B  in  s5 .
- At first we look at the main connective of the formulas:  false   <   true 
  <  variables  <  box formulas  <  diamond formulas  <  negations  <  
  conjunctions  <  disjunctions  <  implications  <  equivalencies. If  A  
  and  B  have the same main connective, we compare the first operands with  
  less , and if these are equal we compare the second operands with  less .
- To compare variable symbols we use a lexicographic ordering that treats 
  successive digits as one number.

EXAMPLE

> less(~p1 & dia dia p0, true v p0);
	true
> less((p0 & box p1) <-> p2, (p0 & dia p1) <-> p2);
	true
> less(p3, p10);
	true
