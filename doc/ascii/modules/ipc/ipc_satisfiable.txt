satisfiable
===========

formula satisfiable ?

SYNTAX
- satisfiable(A) 

PARAMETERS
- A: formula

RESULT:  true  or  false 

SYNOPSIS

- satisfiable  tests whether the formula  A  is satisfiable in  ipc .
- If  satisfiable  is too slow, you can try to apply the following fact: 
  If  A  is satisfiable in  cpc , then  A  is satisfiable in  ipc .
- Note that a formula  B  is satisfiable in  ipc  if and only if  ~B  is not 
  provable in  ipc . However, it is possible that  ~B  is not satisfiable in 
  ipc , but  B  is not provable in  ipc .
- Choose an appropriate infolevel for additional information during the 
  execution (e.g.  set("infolevel", 5); ).

EXAMPLE

> satisfiable((p0 v p1) & ~p0);
	true
> satisfiable(p1 & ~p1);
	false
> satisfiable(~(p0 v ~p0));
  provable(p0 v ~p0);
	false
	false
