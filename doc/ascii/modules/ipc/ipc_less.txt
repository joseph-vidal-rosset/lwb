ordering of formulas

SYNTAX
- less(A, B) 

PARAMETERS
- A, B: formulas

RESULT:  true  or  false 

SYNOPSIS

- less  tests whether the formula  A  is less than the formula  B  in  ipc .
- At first we look at the main connective of the formulas:  false   <   true 
  <  variables  <  negations  <  conjunctions  <  disjunctions  <  
  implications  <  equivalencies. If  A  and  B  have the same main 
  connective, we compare the first operands with  less , and if these are 
  equal we compare the second operands with  less .
- To compare variable symbols we use a lexicographic ordering that treats 
  successive digits as one number.

EXAMPLE

> less((p2 -> p1) & (p2 v p3), p0 v true);
	true
> less((p2 v p1) <-> p2, (p4 v p1) <-> p2);
	true
> less(p7, p61);
	true
