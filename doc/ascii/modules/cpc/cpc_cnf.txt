conjunctive normal form

SYNTAX
- cnf(A) 
- cnf(A, "nosimplify") 

PARAMETERS
- A: formula

RESULT:  formula

SYNOPSIS

- cnf  computes a conjunctive normal form of the formula  A . The resulting 
  formula  cnf(A)  is equivalent to  A , i.e.  A   <-> cnf(A)  is provable 
  in  cpc , and all variables that occur in  cnf(A)  occur already in  A .
- Option  "nosimplify" : The result is not simplified.
- A formula is in conjunctive normal form if it is either  true  or  false  
  or an arranged conjunction of disjunctions of variables and negated 
  variables.
- If the formula  A  is long, then it can help to apply  simplify  first.

EXAMPLE

> cnf(p0 -> p2 & ~p1);
	(p2 v ~p0) & (~p0 v ~p1)
> cnf(p1 v p0 & p1, "nosimplify");
	(p0 v p1) & (p1 v p1)
> cnf((p1 v p2) & (p0 v p3));
	(p0 v p3) & (p1 v p2)
