provable in default theory ?

SYNTAX
- provable(A, Td, Mode) 

PARAMETERS
- A: formula
- Td: theory
- Mode: one of  "one" ,  "all" 

RESULT:  true  or  false 

SYNOPSIS

- Third argument is  "one" :  provable  tests whether the formula  A  is 
  provable in at least one extension of the default theory  Td .
- Third argument is  "all" :  provable  tests whether the formula  A  is 
  provable in all extensions of the default theory  Td .
- Attention: The required space is exponential in the number of defaults in  
  Td . We recommend to use at most 20 defaults.
- Choose an appropriate infolevel for additional information during the 
  execution (e.g.  set("infolevel", 5); ).

EXAMPLE

> provable(p2, [ [p0], [[p0,p2,p2],[p0,~p2,~p2]] ], "one");
	true
> provable(r, [ [p0], [[p0,p2,p2],[p0,~p2,~p2]] ], "all");
	false
