remove superfluous connectives and subformulas

SYNTAX
- remove(A) 
- remove(A, "provable") 
- remove(A, "unary") 
- remove(T) 
- remove(T, "provable") 
- remove(T, "unary") 

PARAMETERS
- A: formula
- T: theory

RESULT:  formula resp. theory

SYNOPSIS

- One argument:  remove  removes  false  and  true  in the formula  A  resp. 
  in the theory  T  (as far as possible without introducing new variables).
- Option  "provable" :  remove  removes subformulas in  A  resp. in  T  that 
  are equivalent to  true  or to  false  (as far as possible without 
  introducing new variables).
- Option  "unary" :  remove  removes superfluous negation symbols,  box 's 
  and  dia 's. No other connectives are changed.
- The result is equivalent to  A  resp. to  T .

EXAMPLE

> remove(true & p0 -> dia(box false -> p1));
	true
> remove((p0 & box p1 -> box box p1) -> ~p2, "provable");
	~p2
> remove([dia box p0 -> p0, p2 v p3, ~ box ~ ~p1], "unary");
	[box p0 -> p0, p2 v p3, ~box p1]
