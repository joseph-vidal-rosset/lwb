Typical non-provable formulas
-----------------------------

In spite of the four equivalencies above we cannot move  box  and  dia  
inwards and outwards in all cases. If this were possible,  s5  would be 
equivalent to classical propositional logic  cpc .

> provable( dia p0 & dia p1  ->  dia(p0 & p1) );
	false
> provable( box(p0 v p1)  ->  box p0 v box p1 );
	false
