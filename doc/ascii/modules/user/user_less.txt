less
====

ordering of expressions

SYNTAX
- less(A, B) 

PARAMETERS
- A, B: expressions

RESULT:  true  or  false 

SYNOPSIS

- less  tests whether the expression  A  is less than the expression  B .
- less  uses a lexicographic ordering with the following properties: There 
  is an arbitrary but fixed linear ordering on the types. If the type of  A  
  is less than the type of  B , then  A  is less than  B . If  A  and  B  
  have the same type, we compare the first operands with  less , and if 
  these are equal, we compare the second operands with  less .
- To compare variable symbols or strings, we use the  strcmp  ordering of  C .

EXAMPLE

> less(f(a),f(b));
	true
> less((p v q1) <-> r, (p v q2) <-> r);
	true
> less(a v b,[a,b]);
	true
