disjunctive normal form

SYNTAX
- dnf(A) 
- dnf(A, "nosimplify") 

PARAMETERS
- A: formula

RESULT:  formula

SYNOPSIS

- dnf  computes a disjunctive normal form of the formula  A . The resulting 
  formula  dnf(A)  is equivalent to  A , i.e.  A <-> dnf(A)  is provable in  
  cpc , and all variables that occur in  dnf(A)  occur already in  A .
- Option "nosimplify" : The result is not simplified.
- A formula is in disjunctive normal form if it is either  true  or  false  
  or an arranged disjunction of conjunctions of variables and negated 
  variables.
- If the formula  A  is long, then it can help to apply  simplify  first.
- In general the result of the function  qmc  is shorter, but this function 
  is only applicable if not too many variables occur in  A .

EXAMPLE

> dnf(p0 -> p2 & ~p1);
	~p0 v p2 & ~p1
> dnf((p1 v p0) & (p0 & ~p1), "nosimplify");
	p0 & p0 & ~p1 v p0 & p1 & ~p1
> dnf((p1 & p2) v (p3 v p0));
	p0 v p3 v p1 & p2
