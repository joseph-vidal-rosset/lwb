ordering of formulas

SYNTAX
- less(A, B) 

PARAMETERS
- A, B: formulas

RESULT:  true  or  false 

SYNOPSIS

- less  tests whether the formula  A  is less than the formula  B  in  s4n .
- At first we look at the main connective of the formulas:  false   <   true 
  <  variables  <  box formulas  <  diamond formulas  <  negations  <  
  conjunctions  <  disjunctions  <  implications  <  equivalencies. Box and 
  diamond formulas are ordered according to the indizes of the modal 
  connectives. If  A  and  B  have the same main connective, we compare the 
  first operands with  less , and if these are equal we compare the second 
  operands with  less .
- To compare variable symbols we use a lexicographic ordering that treats 
  successive digits as one number.

EXAMPLE

> less(p2 & (p1 & dia0 false), p0 -> p1);
	true
> less(p0 v p1 -> dia4 p2, p0 v p1 -> dia3 p2);
	false
> less(p3, p11);
	true
