satisfiable
===========

formula satisfiable ?

SYNTAX
- satisfiable(A) 
- satisfiable(A, Cdnr) 

PARAMETERS
- A: formula
- Cdnr: integer

RESULT:  true ,  false  or  fail 

SYNOPSIS

- satisfiable  tests whether the formula  A  is satisfiable in  ll . Since 
  full linear logic is undecidable the search is limited to the depth  Cdnr ,
  which denotes the maximum number of applications of the combined 
  contraction-dereliction rule (premise  B,?B,Gamma , conclusion  ?B,Gamma 
  ). If  Cdnr  is omitted it defaults to 3.
- If the depth  Cdnr  is exhausted and the satisfiability (result  true ) or 
  the unsatisfiability (result  false ) could not be established,  fail  is 
  returned. In this case you can try to call  satisfiable  with a higher  
  Cdnr .
- If  A  contains no  ?  the satisfiability is decidable and the algorithm 
  returns always  true  or  false .

EXAMPLE

> satisfiable( p0 | (p1 + p2) X p3 );
	true
> satisfiable(~( p0 | ?(~p0 X (p1 | ~p1) )) , 0 );
  satisfiable(~( p0 | ?(~p0 X (p1 | ~p1) )) , 1 );
	fail
	false
