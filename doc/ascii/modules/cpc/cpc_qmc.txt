Quine-McCluskey algorithm

SYNTAX
- qmc(A) 

PARAMETERS
- A: formula

RESULT:  formula in disjunctive normal form

SYNOPSIS

- qmc  applies the Quine-McCluskey algorithm on the formula  A . The result 
  is a formula in disjunctive normal form which is in a certain sense 
  minimal.
- In most cases,  qmc(A)  is shorter than  dnf(A) .
- The algorithm requires exponential memory relative to the number of 
  variables in  A . Therefore it is advisable to simplify the formula 
  first.

EXAMPLE

> qmc(p0 & p1 v p0 & ~p1 v ~p0 & p1);
	p0 v p1
> qmc(p0 <-> p1 <-> p2);
	p0 & p1 & p2 v p0 & ~p1 & ~p2 v p1 & ~p0 & ~p2 v p2 & ~p0 & ~p1
> qmc((p0 -> p1 -> p2) <-> (p1 -> p2));
	p0 v p2 v ~p1
