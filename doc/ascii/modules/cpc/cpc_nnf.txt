SYNOPSIS

- nnf  computes a negation normal form of the formula  A . The resulting

  cpc .
- A formula is in negation normal form if it contains neither  ->  nor  <->  
  and if negations occur only in front of variables.
- Use the function  remove  in order to remove  true  and  false .

EXAMPLE

> nnf(p0 -> p2 & ~p1);
	~p0 v p2 & ~p1
> nnf(p0 & ~(p1 v false v ~(p3 v p0)));
	p0 & (~p1 & true & (p3 v p0))
