remove superfluous connectives and subformulas

SYNTAX
- remove(A) 
- remove(A, "provable") 
- remove(A, "unary") 
- remove(T) 
- remove(T, "provable") 
- remove(T, "unary") 

PARAMETERS
- A: formula
- T: theory

RESULT:  formula resp. theory

SYNOPSIS

- One argument:  remove  removes  false  and  true  in the formula  A  resp. 
  in the theory  T  (as far as possible without introducing new variables).
- Option  "provable" :  remove  removes subformulas in  A  resp. in  T  that 
  are equivalent to  true  or to  false  (as far as possible without 
  introducing new variables).
- Option  "unary" :  remove  removes superfluous negation symbols, i.e.  ~ 
  ~A  is converted to  A , and in equivalences at most one  ~  occurs. No 
  other connectives are changed.
- Case  A : The result is equivalent to  A  (in  cpc ). 
  Case  T : The circumscription theory of  T  (with arbitrary  Lp ,  Lq ) is 
  equivalent to  T  (in  cpc ).

EXAMPLE

> remove((true <-> p0) & p1 -> false);
	~(p0 & p1)
> remove([~ ~ ~false, (p2 -> ~p0) <-> true]);
	[p2 -> ~p0]
> remove([~ ~ ~false, (p2 -> ~p0) <-> true], "provable");
	[p2 -> ~p0]
> remove(~ ~ ~(~p0 v (~p1 <-> ~p3)), "unary");
	~(~p0 v (p1 <-> p3))
