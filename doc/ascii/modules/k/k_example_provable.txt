Typical provable formulas
-------------------------

All formulas that are provable in classical propositional logic are also 
provable in the modal logic  k .
Therefore we concentrate on formulas typical for  k .

> provable( box(p0 & p1)  <->  box p0 & box p1 );
	true
> provable( dia(p0 v p1)  <->  dia p0 v dia p1 );
	true
> provable( ~ box ~ p0  <-> dia p0 );
	true
> provable( box(p0 -> p1) -> box p0 -> box p1 );
	true

Although the formula  dia(p v ~p)  is not provable, it is provable in  k  
plus the theory with  dia q  as its only element. The formula  dia q  
guarantees that there exists an accessible world, and as soon as such a 
world exists  dia(p v ~p)  is true.

> provable(dia(p0 v ~p0), [dia p1]);
	true
