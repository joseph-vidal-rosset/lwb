nnf
===

negation normal form

SYNTAX
- nnf(A) 
- nnf(A, "sat") 

PARAMETERS
- A: formula

RESULT:  formula

SYNOPSIS

- nnf  computes a negation normal form of the formula  A .
- The result is equivalent to  A , i.e.  nnf(A) <-> A  is provable in  pltl .
- If the option  "sat"  is given, a similar normal form is computed, which 
  is more appropriate for the satisfiability check (the `before' connective 
  and the equivalence are treated differently).

EXAMPLE

> nnf(p1 -> (G p2 v ~ (p3 B p4)));
	~p1 v (G p2 v (~p3 U p4))
> nnf(~p1 v X F p2);
	~p1 v X F p2
