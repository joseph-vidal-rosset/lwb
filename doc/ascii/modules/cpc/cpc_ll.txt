ll
==

embedding in  ll 

SYNTAX
- ll(A) 

PARAMETERS
- A: formula

RESULT:  formula of  ll 

SYNOPSIS

- ll  embeds the formula  A  in linear logic, or, more precisely, in MALL, 
  the Multiplicative-Additive fragment of Linear Logic (i.e., the result 
  contains no exponentials).
- The result is provable in  ll  iff the original formula is provable in  
  cpc  (if the variables of  A  in  cpc  are also variables in  ll ).

EXAMPLE

> ll( p0 -> p0 v p1 );
	p0 & 1 -o p0 + bot | (p1 + bot)
> ll( p0 & p0 -> p0 );
	p0 & 1 X (p0 & 1) -o p0 + bot
