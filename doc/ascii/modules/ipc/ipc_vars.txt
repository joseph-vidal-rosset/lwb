====

occurring variables

SYNTAX
- vars(A) 
- vars(T) 
- vars(A, S) 
- vars(T, S) 

PARAMETERS
- A: formula
- T: theory
- S: one of  "pos" ,  "neg" 

RESULT:  list of variables

SYNOPSIS

- vars  computes the list of variables of  ipc  that occur in the formula  A 
  resp. in the theory  T .
- The resulting list is sorted according to the ordering given by  less , 
  and no element occurs twice in it.
- If the second argument is  "pos" , then only the positive occurrences are 
  listed. If the second argument is  "neg" , then only the negative 
  occurrences are listed.

EXAMPLE

> vars(p2 & (p0 -> ~p1) -> p0 v ~p0);
	[p0, p1, p2]
> vars(p2 & (p0 -> ~p1) -> p0 v ~p0, "pos");
	[p0, p1]
> vars(p2 & (p0 -> ~p1) -> p0 v ~p0, "neg");
	[p0, p2]
> vars(true);
	[]
> vars([p3 -> p2 v p10, p10 v p2, p2 v p3]);
	[p2, p3, p10]
