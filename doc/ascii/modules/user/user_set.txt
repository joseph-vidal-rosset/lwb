set the configuration values

SYNTAX
- set("bracketmode", SB) 
- set("helpmode", SH) 
- set("infolevel", N) 
- set("outputmode", SO) 
- set("percents", F) 
- set("percentsdelay", N) 

PARAMETERS
- SB: one of  "assoc" ,  "full" 
- SH: one of  "ascii" ,  "www" 
- N: natural number
- SO: one of  "ascii" ,  "inputformat" ,  "latex" ,  "pretty" 
- F: one of  true ,  false 

RESULT:  true 

SYNOPSIS

- First argument is  "bracketmode" : The default value is  "assoc"  . If the 
  bracket mode is  "full" , then all brackets are displayed.
- First argument is  "helpmode" : The default value is  "www"  ; then help 
  is displayed using a WWW browser. If the bracket mode is  "ascii" , then 
  help is displayed in ASCII format. If you use a graphical user interface, 
  then the info window is used.
- First argument is  "infolevel"  : If  N  is  0 , then no additional 
  information is printed. The greater  N  is, the more information is 
  printed about the running functions. If additional information is 
  available for a function, then it is described in its help page.
- First argument is  "outputmode" : The default value is  "ascii"  . A line 
  obtained with  "inputformat"  can be used for copy-and-paste whatever the 
  current top module is. The value  "pretty"  is used in connection with a 
  font that contains special symbols e.g. for connectives. For more 
  information see the WWW page on the graphical user interface you are using 
  (e.g. XLWB, MacLWB).
- First argument is  "percents" : If  F  is  true , then percent values are 
  shown.
- First argument is  "percentsdelay " : The percent values are only shown 
  after a delay of  N /100 seconds. The default value for  N  is 100. Assume 
  e.g. that you have a  for  loop containing a call of a decision procedure. 
  If you set the value to 0, then you will be slowed down considerably 
  because of the numerous displayed percent values. With the default value, 
  you will obtain the percent values only for the harder formulas, that is 
  the efficiency is hardly influenced.
