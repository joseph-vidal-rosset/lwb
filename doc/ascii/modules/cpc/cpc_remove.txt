remove superfluous connectives and subformulas

SYNTAX
- remove(A) 
- remove(A, "provable") 
- remove(A, "unary") 
- remove(T) 
- remove(T, "provable") 
- remove(T, "unary") 

PARAMETERS
- A: formula
- T: theory

RESULT:  formula resp. theory

SYNOPSIS

- One argument:  remove  removes  false  and  true  in the formula  A  resp. 
  in the theory  T  (as far as possible without introducing new variables).
- Option  "provable" :  remove  removes subformulas in  A  resp. in  T  that 
  are equivalent to  true  or to  false  (as far as possible without 
  introducing new variables).
- Option  "unary" :  remove  removes superfluous negation symbols, i.e.  ~ 
  ~A  is converted to  A , and in equivalences at most one  ~  occurs. No 
  other connectives are changed.
- The result is equivalent to  A  resp. to  T .

EXAMPLE

> remove((true v p0) & p1 -> false);
	~p1
> remove([true, ~(p0 v p1 v ~p0) <-> true]);
	[~(p0 v p1 v ~p0)]
> remove([true, ~(p0 v p1 v ~p0) <-> true], "provable");
	[false]
> remove(~ ~(p0 v ~(~p1 <-> ~(~p2 <-> ~p3))), "unary");
	p0 v (p1 <-> (p2 <-> ~p3))
