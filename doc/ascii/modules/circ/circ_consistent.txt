circumscription theory consistent ?

SYNTAX
- consistent(T, Lp) 
- consistent(T, Lp, Lq) 

PARAMETERS
- T: theory
- Lp, Lq: disjunct lists of variables

RESULT:  true  or  false 

SYNOPSIS

- consistent  tests whether the circumscription theory of the theory  T  is 
  consistent. The variables in  Lp  are minimized, the variables in  Lq  are 
  varied.
- The circumscription theory of  T  is consistent iff  T  itself is 
  consistent in  cpc .
- Choose an appropriate infolevel for additional information during the 
  execution (e.g.  set("infolevel", 6); ).

EXAMPLE

> consistent([p0 v p1, p1 -> p2], [p0,p2], [p1]);
