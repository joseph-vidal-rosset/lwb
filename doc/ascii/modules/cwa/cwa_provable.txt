provable in closed world assumption

SYNTAX
- provable(A, T) 
- provable(A, T, Vars) 

PARAMETERS
- A: formula
- T: theory
- Vars: list of variables

RESULT:  true  or  false 

SYNOPSIS

- Two arguments:  provable  tests whether the formula  A  is provable in the 
  closed world assumption theory of the theory  T  (no restriction of 
  variables).
- Three arguments:  provable  tests whether the formula  A  is provable in 
  the closed world assumption theory restricted on the variables in  Vars  
  of the theory  T .
- Choose an appropriate infolevel for additional information during the 
  execution (e.g.  set("infolevel", 3); ).

EXAMPLE

> provable(p1 & ~p2, [p0, p0 -> p1]);
	true
> provable(~p3 & ~p4, [p0, p1], [p1, p3]);
	false
> provable(~p3 & ~p4, [p0, p1], [p1, p3, p4]);
	true
