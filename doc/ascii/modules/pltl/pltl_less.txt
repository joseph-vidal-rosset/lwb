ordering of formulas

SYNTAX
- less(A, B) 

PARAMETERS
- A, B: formulas

RESULT:  true  or  false 

SYNOPSIS

- less  tests whether the formula  A  is less than the formula  B  in  pltl .
- At first we look at the main connective of the formulas:  false   <   true 
  <  variables  <   X  formulas  <   F  formulas  <   G  formulas  <  
  negations  <   B  formulas  <   U  formulas  <  conjunctions  <  
  disjunctions  <  implications  <  equivalencies. If  A  and  B  have the 
  same main connective, we compare the first operands with  less , and if 
  these are equal we compare the second operands with  less .
- To compare variable symbols we use a lexicographic ordering that treats 
  successive digits as one number.

EXAMPLE

> less((p2 -> X p3) & (p2 v p4), p1 v true);
	true
> less((p2 U p3) <-> G p2, (p1 U p2) <-> G p3);
	false
> less(p7, p61);
	true
