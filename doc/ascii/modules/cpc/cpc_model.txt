model of a formula

SYNTAX
- model(A) 

PARAMETERS
- A: formula

RESULT:  sorted list of variables or  fail 

SYNOPSIS

- model  computes a model  M  in  cpc  such that  cpc::value(A,M)  is  true .
  If there exists no model, i.e. if the formula  A  is not satisfiable, then 
  the result is  fail .
- If the formula is too hard for  cpc::model , then you can try to use  
  cpc::bddsat  in order to find out whether or not the formula is 
  satisfiable.
- Choose an appropriate infolevel for additional information during the 
  execution (e.g.  set("infolevel", 3); ).

EXAMPLE

> model(p2 & p1 & p3);
	[p1, p2, p3]
> model((p0 & ~p1 & p2 & p3 v ~p0 & p1) & p0);
	[p0, p2, p3]
> model(p0 & p1 & ~(p0 v p2));
	fail
